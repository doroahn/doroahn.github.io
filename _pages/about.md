I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ling.rutgers.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a> at Rutgers University and the P.I. of the <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/themallab/">Meaning Across Languages lab üòà</a>.

As a semanticist interested in cross-linguistic patterns, I investigate how the underlying building blocks of meaning compose to derive the patterns that we see within and across languages. To do so, I make use of both formal theoretic and experimental approaches to natural language semantics and pragmatics.
 
I received my Ph.D in Linguistics from <a href="https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> in May 2019 with <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004742">a dissertation looking at definite expressions</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/gennaro-chierchia">Gennaro Chierchia</a>, <a href="https://ulisauerland.github.io/">Uli Sauerland</a>, <a href="https://kathryndavidson.scholars.harvard.edu/">Kate Davidson</a>, and <a href="https://www.harvardlds.org/our-labs/snedeker-lab/">Jesse Snedeker</a>. I am generally interested in elements that are associated (at least structurally) with the nominal domain such as demonstratives, anaphora, number marking, and quantifiers.
