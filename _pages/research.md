**Definiteness and anaphoric expressions**

It is generally assumed that pronouns, definites, and demonstratives are separate semantic elements. However, cross-linguistic studies suggest that the morphosyntactically based distinction between these expressions do not always align with underlying meaning. In this line of work, I argue that the underlying semantics of these expressions are identical except for the restrictions that they carry, proposing a unified analysis that extends the general schema of a definite.

**Demonstratives and pointing**

Demonstratives received much attention in semantics and philosophy for their deictic and non-deictic uses. In gesture linguistics, demonstratives also show a unique behavior of bringing meaning of gesture to at-issue. I propose a new analysis of demonstratives based their ability to refer to non-familiar entities.
